Every year, exactly at the same time for everyone, the cure takes effect, but it only works 12% of the time. Furthermore, 8% of those who are healthy will become sick and 2% of the population will give birth (let us assume there is no age or sex) – the birth will occur just before the other actions, so if someone is born they could become sick immediately after. Will there be a time at which the ratio of healthy people to sick people remains constant, if so, what is this ratio? ",
